Title: INC-20260105-01 Auction ask1 amount unit mismatch

Summary

Auction Phase2/Phase3 amount thresholds for fb/zb were derived from ask1
volume. The ask1 volume unit (shares) did not match the sample logic (lots),
so the 15e6/3e6 checks could be off by 100x.

Context

AuctionSellStrategy computes amount thresholds using buy_price1 * ask_vol1 to
gate fb/zb conditions. The original Python sample used ask_vol * 100, implying
lot-based volume. The TDF snapshot nAskVol is assumed to be in shares.

Observed Issues

- fb/zb condition triggers were inconsistent with the sample behavior.
- Amount thresholds appeared too tight or too loose depending on unit usage.

Root Causes

- Volume unit mismatch between the sample script (lots) and TDF snapshot
  (shares).
- The conversion rule was not explicitly documented in the C++ port.

Fixes (Algorithm)

- Treat ask_vol1 as shares and compute amount thresholds as price * shares.
- Document the unit assumption for ask_volume1 in the strategy notes.

Files Updated

- result/src/strategies/AuctionSellStrategy.cpp

Validation

- Not run. Suggested: replay a known auction window and confirm fb/zb triggers
  align with expectations.

Open Questions / Risks

- Confirm ask_volume units from SDK docs or snapshot logs.
