Title: INC-20260103-01 Auction limit-up skip condition inverted

Summary

Auction Phase1/Phase2 could sell when limit-up was sealed, contrary to the
sample spec, because the skip condition was inverted.

Context

Auction strategy Phase1/Phase2 reads order book and decides whether to skip
selling when a stock is limit-up and sealed (ask2 volume is zero). The expected
logic is based on the sample spec in sample/ and is implemented in
result/src/strategies/AuctionSellStrategy.cpp.

Observed Issues

- Strategy skipped when ask2 had volume, but spec says skip when ask2 has no
  volume (sealed).
- Phase1/Phase2 placed orders under sealed limit-up conditions.

Root Causes

- The limit-up skip check used the opposite condition (`ask_vol2 > 0`).
- The inversion likely happened during translation from the sample spec.

Fixes (Algorithm)

- Skip Phase1/Phase2 when `buy1` is at limit-up and `ask2` volume is 0
  (sealed).
- Keep Phase3 logic unchanged.

Why sealed limit-up was not skipped

The condition checked for `ask_vol2 > 0` instead of `ask_vol2 <= 0`, so sealed
limit-up cases were treated as tradable.

Files Updated

- result/src/strategies/AuctionSellStrategy.cpp

Validation

- Not run. Suggested: replay or live test and confirm no orders when limit-up
  is sealed.

Open Questions / Risks

- Only Phase1/Phase2 are affected. Phase3 behavior is unchanged.
