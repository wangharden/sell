Title: INC-20260107-02 Auction Phase3 weak-seal logic missing

Summary

The new auction script added a weak-seal check before the unsealed (ask2>0,
bid2<=0) branch. The C++ Phase3 logic still used the old half-sell path and
did not match the updated behavior.

Context

In sample/qh2h竞价卖出new.txt (lines ~228-247), the logic adds:
- weak-seal: bid1==zt_price and bid_vol2 < 2*ask_vol1 -> sell full at zt-0.01
- unsealed: bid1==zt_price and ask_vol2>0 and bid_vol2<=0 -> sell full
Phase3 in AuctionSellStrategy was still based on the earlier script.

Observed Issues

- Weak-seal state was not detected or handled in C++.
- Unsealed branch sold half instead of full size.

Root Causes

- C++ port lagged behind the updated sample logic.
- Phase3 logic remained tied to the old half-sell rule.

Fixes (Algorithm)

- Add weak-seal check using snapshot.bid_volume2 and snapshot.ask_volume1.
- Keep unsealed check (ask_vol2>0 && bid_vol2<=0) and sell full size.
- Set limit_sell after a sell and skip further Phase3 processing for that symbol.

Files Updated

- result/src/strategies/AuctionSellStrategy.cpp

Validation

- Not run. Suggested: replay auction window and confirm Phase3 matches the
  new script outcomes.

Open Questions / Risks

- Confirm L2 volumes are available for all symbols (bid_volume2/ask_volume2).
- Ensure ratio caps and downstream conditions are intentionally skipped after
  limit-sell.
