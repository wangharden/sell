Title: INC-20260107-01 Auction sell_to_mkt_ratio hardcoded

Summary

AuctionSellStrategy kept sell_to_mkt_ratio_ at a fixed default (0.1), which
prevented runtime tuning and contradicted the field dictionary that expects
the value to come from config.json.

Context

AuctionSellStrategy applies sell_to_mkt_ratio_ in Phase2/Phase3 caps. The
config schema already includes a strategy section and ConfigReader is used by
usage_example to read configuration.

Observed Issues

- Ratio changes required code edits and rebuilds.
- Per-run or per-environment tuning was not possible.

Root Causes

- sell_to_mkt_ratio_ was hardcoded as a member default.
- No config read path existed for the ratio.

Fixes (Algorithm)

- Add strategy.sell_to_mkt_ratio to config.json.
- Add ConfigReader::get_strategy_sell_to_mkt_ratio().
- Pass ratio into AuctionSellStrategy constructor and store it in the instance.

Files Updated

- result/config.json
- result/src/core/ConfigReader.h
- result/src/strategies/AuctionSellStrategy.h
- result/src/strategies/AuctionSellStrategy.cpp
- result/examples/usage_example.cpp

Validation

- Not run. Suggested: run usage_example and confirm ratio is read from config.

Open Questions / Risks

- ConfigReader uses lightweight parsing; malformed values fall back to default.
- No bounds check for ratio (negative or >1).
