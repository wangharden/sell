Title: INC-20260106-01 Auction ratio cap mixed units and lot rounding

Summary

Phase2/Phase3 ratio caps compared total_sell with ask1 volume. The comparison
used mixed units (lots vs shares), and Phase3 cap could yield non-100-share
volumes, conflicting with the order interface.

Context

AuctionSellStrategy uses sell_to_mkt_ratio_ to limit sell volume relative to
ask1. total_sell is accumulated in shares. ask_vol1 (TDF nAskVol) is treated
as shares. Orders are required to be 100-share lots.

Observed Issues

- Ratio cap was ineffective or 100x off because total_sell was divided by 100.
- Phase3 cap produced odd-lot volumes after switching to share-based compare.

Root Causes

- Mixed unit comparison (total_sell in shares vs ask_vol1 in shares but
  total_sell divided by 100).
- Lot-size rounding missing in Phase3 cap calculation.

Fixes (Algorithm)

- Compare shares-to-shares: total_sell >= ask_vol1 * ratio.
- Round Phase3 cap down to 100-share multiples before applying to vol.

Validation

- Not run. Suggested: replay auction window and confirm cap behavior and
  no odd-lot orders.

Open Questions / Risks

- Confirm ask_volume units and whether the broker accepts odd lots.
