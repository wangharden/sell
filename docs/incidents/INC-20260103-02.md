Title: INC-20260103-02 pre_close unit mismatch with limit-up prices

Summary

pre_close and limit-up prices were in different units, which could miscompute
open_ratio and limit-up checks, leading to incorrect skip or trigger behavior.

Context

pre_close is loaded from CSV and limits are sourced from market snapshots. The
strategy logic compares these values in
result/src/strategies/* and uses CsvConfig and TdfMarketDataApi to ingest and
normalize prices.

Observed Issues

- pre_close appeared in raw units while limit-up prices were in price units.
- Comparisons and ratios drifted because of mixed scales.

Root Causes

- Prices were sourced from multiple inputs with different unit conventions.
- Normalization was missing or inconsistently applied at ingestion.

Fixes (Algorithm)

- Normalize CSV close when it is in raw units (divide by 10000 when needed).
- Ensure snapshot pre_close/limits are converted to price units at ingestion.
- Use normalized values for all limit-up comparisons and ratio calculations.

Why the mismatch happened

CSV close values and snapshot limits were handled with different scaling rules,
so the derived pre_close did not align with limit-up prices.

Files Updated

- result/src/core/CsvConfig.cpp
- result/src/adapters/TdfMarketDataApi.cpp
- result/src/strategies/* (uses pre_close/zt_price)

Validation

- Not run. Suggested: replay a day with known limit-up and confirm open_ratio
  and skip conditions match expectations.

Open Questions / Risks

- If any upstream source changes price scaling, unit checks must be updated.
