Title: INC-20260119-01 AfterOpen orders missed cancel window (603638)

Summary

603638 had orders that remained submitted/unfilled at pre-close because
AfterOpen orders (100017~100022) were placed after the auction cancel stage
and were not covered by any later cancel phase.

Context

We replayed the full order flow for 603638 from the log. Pre-market/auction
orders were filled. AfterOpen orders were placed around 09:29~09:30 and later
observed as still submitted/unfilled near close.

Observed Issues

- Near close, orders 100017~100022 remained status=2 filled=0.
- Evidence:
  - D:\work\sell\result\trading_test_data_pid19920_20260119.log:7548249
  - D:\work\sell\result\trading_test_data_pid19920_20260119.log:7548254

Root Causes

- cancel_auction_orders() ran at 09:25, before AfterOpen orders existed.
- No subsequent cancel phase covered AfterOpen orders, so they stayed live.

Fixes (Algorithm)

- TBD. Add a cancel stage that covers AfterOpen orders (or extend the existing
  cancel window) so late auction/after-open submissions are not missed.

Files Updated

- None (incident record only).

Validation

- Log replay confirmed the stuck orders and timing gap; no code change applied.

Open Questions / Risks

- Confirm the intended cancel policy for AfterOpen orders (time window/rules).
- Check if other symbols during the same window show similar leftover orders.
